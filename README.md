# Tic-tac-toe with Minimax algorithm

## About

Tic-tac-toe  is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

## Minimax algorithm

This algorithm is used in decision making and game theory. It is widely used in two player turn-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe.
